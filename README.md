# SocketChat
This Project started with me wanting to wrap my head around TCP in C#.<br>
The solution consists of 2 projects.<br>
The test console app which was just to work out the basics.<br>
The windows forms GUI Version.<br>
I also improved the GUI Version to support multiple clients via peer to peer with the host relaying messages to all the clients.
